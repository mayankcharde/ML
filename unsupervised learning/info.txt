🔹 Ensemble Learning Methods in AI & Machine Learning

Ensemble learning is a powerful technique where multiple models (learners) are combined to solve the same problem and produce better performance than any single model alone.

👉 Core idea:

“Many weak learners together form a strong learner.”

🎯 Why Ensemble Learning?

✅ Higher accuracy

✅ Reduced overfitting

✅ Better generalization

✅ Improved robustness

🔶 Main Types of Ensemble Learning
1️⃣ Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)

Concept

Train multiple models on different random subsets of the same dataset (sampling with replacement).

Combine predictions using majority voting (classification) or averaging (regression).

Goal
👉 Reduce variance

Best For

High-variance models (e.g., decision trees)

Key Algorithm

Random Forest

How it works

Create multiple bootstrapped datasets

Train a model on each dataset

Aggregate predictions

2️⃣ Boosting

Concept

Models are trained sequentially

Each new model focuses more on the mistakes of the previous one

Goal
👉 Reduce bias

Best For

Weak learners that slightly outperform random guessing

Popular Algorithms

AdaBoost

Gradient Boosting

XGBoost

LightGBM

CatBoost

How it works

Train initial model

Increase weight of misclassified samples

Train next model on harder cases

Combine all models

3️⃣ Stacking (Stacked Generalization)

Concept

Combine different types of models

Use a meta-model to learn how to best combine their predictions

Goal
👉 Learn optimal model combination

Example

Base models: Decision Tree, SVM, Logistic Regression

Meta-model: Logistic Regression

How it works

Train base models

Generate predictions

Train meta-model on predictions
